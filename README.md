CS 106R is a pioneer, 7-week course developed by two master's students from Stanford University as a means to show high-school students the applications of Computer Science in the world of academia and research. The course balances emphasis on both the theory and applications of Computer Science by teaching the core principles of computational theory with a project-based curriculum. 
By the end of the course, students will have a basic understanding of the skills necessary to build their own data science projects. Students will be able to process and analyze large datasets and create powerful programs capable of visualizing the nature of the data at hand.
