Hi! Welcome to the course notes for CS 106R. On this page, you'll find all of the material we'll cover in the class. We designed these course notes to be as lightweight as possible – that is, they cover all the essentials but won't dive into material too deeply. Throughout you will find links to external resources we've found helpful in understanding concepts.

## What is Computer Science? 
When you hear the words "computer science", what comes to mind? Do you think of computer programming – neon text on a black screen? Do you think of algorithms and equations scribbled on a whiteboard? Perhaps, when you hear "computer science", you think of computer and phone applications, websites and video games: WhatsApp, FIFA 18, PhotoShop. Maybe you think of [computers that drive](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609450/autonomous-vehicles-are-you-ready-for-the-new-ride/), [beat us at board games](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html) and [make sense of language](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/ais-ability-to-read-hailed-as-historical-milestone-but-computers-arent-quite-there/2018/01/16/04638f2e-faf6-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.285b937ed479). Maybe you've seen the power of [molecular dynamics simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JcFgj2gHx8) and you think of biology or chemistry. Or when you hear computer science you think of art – personally, I often think of [this Pixar short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkQTe0Wdo2k) and marvel at the unbelieavable rendering of the ocean – or [music](https://vimeo.com/100624271) made by instruments that could only be forged with code. Maybe you think of [goal line technology](https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/standards/goal-line-technology/), applications that track your fitness, or [statistical models](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/) that predict the outcomes of football tournaments. Perhaps you're concerned about all the personal information that you hand over to Facebook and you think of the recent [Facebook-Cambridge Analytica fiasco](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html). When you hear computer science you might think of the [economic implications of automation](https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/april11.pdf) and its impact on inequality. 

Or maybe, when someone says computer science you don't really think of anything at all. 

The thing is: computer science is no more one of these things than another – its all of them plus a whole lot more. We define computer science as **the science of using computers to solve problems**, and those problems can be any problem we care to solve. The bottom line is: if we are getting a computer to solve a problem that it couldn't before, then we are practicing computer science – it doesn't matter if we're making music, practicing medicine or doing research. So, as you go into this course, we'd recommend that you don't dwell to much on your preconceived notions of what computer science is or isnt – rather marvel at the fact 

## What is Computer Programming? 
Computer programming is an important part of computer science. **But**, computer programming is no more computer science than

## Simple Functions
How do we get Python to If we want to print something we can call print(). 

## Basic Types  
| Type        | Description   | Example  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| **int**           | Positive and negative integers.              |           1, 345, -6         |
| **float**         | Real numbers i.e. numbers with decimal points      | 1.0, 3.14, 1e-2, -0.22|
| **string**        | Text .  | "Colegio Bom Jesus", "Winter is coming." |
| **bool**          | True or false               | True, False        |
