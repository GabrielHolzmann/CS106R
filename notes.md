title: Course Notes

Hi! Welcome to the course notes for CS 106R. On this page, you'll find all of the material we'll cover in the class. We designed these course notes to be as lightweight as possible – that is, they cover all the essentials but won't dive into material too deeply. Throughout you will find links to external resources we've found helpful in understanding concepts.

## What is Computer Science? 
When you hear the words "computer science", what comes to mind? Do you think of computer programming – neon text on a black screen? Do you think of algorithms and equations scribbled on a whiteboard? Perhaps, when you hear "computer science", you think of computer and phone applications, websites and video games: WhatsApp, FIFA 18, PhotoShop. Perhaps you think of [computers that drive](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609450/autonomous-vehicles-are-you-ready-for-the-new-ride/), [beat us at board games](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html) and [make sense of language](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/ais-ability-to-read-hailed-as-historical-milestone-but-computers-arent-quite-there/2018/01/16/04638f2e-faf6-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.285b937ed479). Maybe you've seen the power of [molecular dynamics simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JcFgj2gHx8) and you think of biology or chemistry. Or maybe when you hear computer science you think of art – personally, I often think of [this Pixar short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkQTe0Wdo2k) and marvel at science behind the beauty of the ocean – or [music](https://vimeo.com/100624271) made by instruments that could only be forged with code. Maybe you think of [goal line technology](https://football-technology.fifa.com/en/standards/goal-line-technology/), applications that track your fitness, or [statistical models](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/) that predict the outcomes of sporting events. Maybe questions of data privacy and security concern you and you think Maybe when someone says computer science you don't really think of anything at all. The thing is: computer science is no more one of these things than another, and its perfectly reasonable to  indeed, it can quite literally be anything at all. At the risk of sounding cliché, computer science  We think its most productive to define computer science very generally: **the science of using computers to solve problems that are important to us**. 

Computer Science is **using computers to solve problems that are important to us**.   it doesn't matter what you think computer science

## Simple Functions
How do we get Python to If we want to print something we can call print(). 

## Basic Types  
| Type        | Description   | Example  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| **int**           | Positive and negative integers.              |           1, 345, -6         |
| **float**         | Real numbers i.e. numbers with decimal points      | 1.0, 3.14, 1e-2, -0.22|
| **string**        | Text .  | "Colegio Bom Jesus", "Winter is coming." |
| **bool**          | True or false               | True, False        |
