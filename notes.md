Hi! Welcome to the course notes for CS 106R. On this page, you'll find all of the material we'll cover in the class. We designed these course notes to be as lightweight as possible – that is, they cover all the essentials but won't dive into material too deeply. Throughout you will find links to external resources we've found helpful in understanding concepts.

## What is Computer Science? 
When you hear the words "computer science", what comes to mind? Do you think of computer programming – neon text on a black screen? Do you think of algorithms and equations scribbled on a whiteboard? Perhaps, when you hear "computer science", you think of your computer and phone applications, websites and video games: WhatsApp, FIFA 18, PhotoShop. Perhaps you think of artifical intelligence – [computers that drive](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609450/autonomous-vehicles-are-you-ready-for-the-new-ride/), [beat us at chess] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html) and make sense of language. Maybe you've seen one  think of biology and medicine – molecular simulations or MRI machines. Maybe when you hear computer science you think of Finding Nemo art – of music from an electronic instrument that could only be crafted in code or     . Maybe when someone says computer science you think of something else altogether or you don't really know what to think of at all.  The thing is: computer science is no more one of these things than another – indeed, it can quite literally be anything. 

Computer Science is using computers to solve problems that are important to us.   it doesn't matter what you think computer science
